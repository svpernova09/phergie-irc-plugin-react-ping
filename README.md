# renegade334/phergie-irc-plugin-react-ping

[Phergie](http://github.com/phergie/phergie-irc-bot-react/) plugin for verifying that the client connection has not been dropped by sending self CTCP PINGs after periods of inactivity.

If the ping is not received within a given timeout period, the plugin tells the client to disconnect the connection.
